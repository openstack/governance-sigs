    The objective of the Upgrade SIG is to improve the overall upgrade
    process for OpenStack Clouds, covering both offline 'fast-forward'
    upgrades and online 'rolling' upgrades, by providing a forum for
    cross-project collaboration between operators and developers to
    document and codify best practice for upgrading OpenStack.
