  status: completed
  reason: >
    The technical writing SIG has provided the guidelines and tooling to move
    the documentation ownership to the projects. Now we have significantly less
    amount of work under this SIG and having fewer or maintainer for this SIG
    in the Yoga cycle, we decided to merge this SIG into the Technical Committee.
    Contact OpenStack Technical Committee for any query related to this SIG.
