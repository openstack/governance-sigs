 OpenStack SIGs
================

The OpenStack SIGs (Special Interest Groups) are a form of
working group in OpenStack that is an emanation of the community
as a whole and is not directly tied to a specific governance body.

SIGs are a good match for an activity that centers around a topic
or practice that spans all the community (developers, operators,
end users...), by forming a guild of people with a shared interest.

SIG communications
==================

Communication between SIG members happens on the
`openstack-sigs mailing-list`_, using a subject [prefix] matching the
SIG name. SIG work output can of course be posted to other mailing-lists
as needed to reach other groups.

Process to create a SIG
=======================

To propose creation of a SIG, please propose a change to the
``sigs.yaml`` file in the ``openstack/governance-sigs`` repository.
That change will be reviewed by members of the Meta SIG. If you have
questions, please ask them on the `openstack-sigs mailing-list`_ with
prefix ``[meta]``.
