 OpenStack SIGs
================

The OpenStack SIGs (Special Interest Groups) are a form of
working group in OpenStack that is an emanation of the community
as a whole and is not directly tied to a specific governance body.

SIGs are a good match for an activity that centers around a topic
or practice that spans all the community (developers, operators,
end users...), by forming a guild of people with a shared interest.
