Guidelines for OpenStack SIGs (Special Interest Groups)
=======================================================

Before we dive into more details, it is important to learn what a SIG is and
what the differences are to other work groups in OpenStack. Please check
`Comparison of Official Group Structures`_ for more detail.


SIGs lifecycle
==============

Before creating a SIG
---------------------

Before creating a SIG, you should check out the existing `SIGs`_ and see if
your goals could not be shared with an existing group.

If not, you should raise a thread on the openstack-discuss mailing-list about
creating a new SIG. That should allow you to raise visibility of the SIG,
get more feedback, refine the SIG scope, and recruit more volunteers.

Creating a SIG
--------------

To formally propose a SIG you'll need to propose a change to the
`SIG Governance`_ file. That change will be reviewed and approved by the
`OpenStack Technical Committee`_.

The change should include the chosen name for the SIG (a combination of
ASCII letters, `-` and space), the proposed SIG scope, the initial status
(usually "forming") and the name of the SIG chair(s). It's strongly
encouraged to have more than one chair in order to spread the load.

Particular attention should be paid to the SIG scope. Documenting down the
very reason for this SIG will help others who have similar interests to join
this group. It's important to learn why we need to form a SIG, where we need
this SIG, and what's the goal and responsibility of this SIG.

Here is an `example of a SIG creation request`_.

Keeping SIG status up to date
-----------------------------

Once the SIG is approved, it is important to keep its filing in
`SIG Governance`_  up to date. In particular, keeping the status, chairs,
and scope up to date.

SIG status may be:

forming
~~~~~~~

The SIG is still setting up. This status also applied to SIG which needs to
regroup.

active
~~~~~~

The SIG reaches out for discussion, have plans for current
cycle, host meetings or send messages about status out to the mailing-list
regularly.

advisory
~~~~~~~~

The SIG is not actively meeting or driving specific goals every cycle. SIG
members stay around for help, make sure everything stays working and
provide advice when needed.

The SIG will keep the owned repository or documents up to date and will accept
updates on-demand.

unknown
~~~~~~~

SIG status is unknown, the TC is currently working to update its status.

Retiring a SIG
--------------

Inactive SIGs can be made "advisory" if SIG members are still available for
answering questions, or they can be retired.

To retire a SIG, propose a change that moves its definition from
`SIG Governance`_ to the `Completed SIGs`_ file, removing the status field.


Best practices for running a SIG
================================

SIG chairs role
---------------

A chair is encouraged as a moderator for the following work:

* Organize meeting agenda and host meetings
* Organize polling
* Coordinate with SIG members to generate a schedule for possible upcoming
  events (Summit, PTG, etc.) if needed.
* Moderate SIG tasks and help to find and encourage action takers for each
  task.
* Welcome new members to join the SIG.

SIG communications
------------------

Due to SIG differences, each SIG might have its own way to communicate. The
only requirement is that the SIG communications are well documented, so that
interested parties can easily join. Here are a few suggestions:

Mailing List
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Asynchronous communication between SIG members happens on the
`OpenStack-discuss mailing-list`_, prefixing the subject with [$signame-sig]
where $signame matches the SIGâ€™s name. SIG work output can, of course, be
posted to other mailing-lists as needed to reach other groups.

IRC
~~~

IRC is the preferred method of communication as it aligns with OpenStack
community best practices for inclusive, synchronous messaging.

If your SIG uses a specific IRC channel, Opendev provides a number of IRC bots
to assist with logging. You can read more about `IRC services`_ and see an
`example for adding status/meeting bot to channel`_.

IRC meetings
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you run regular SIG meetings, you should consider to post the meeting
schedule for SIG. SIG members can decide the meeting schedule (frequency
and location) and make sure there will be moderator for each meeting.
Here's an `example for adding meeting schedule`_ to `meeting list`_.

.. note::
   Meeting location can be at SIG's IRC channel or other public places if
   more desired (Like K8s SIG uses Slack channel in K8s community for
   meeting). Make sure meeting location allows public access so everyone can
   join.

Post SIG news regularly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's encouraged to provide updates for all who might be interested in
learning. This can be done through the mailing list, or instant messaging
channels. Keeping everyone informed of the SIG progress helps to attract new
members, and to make sure others know about the new changes.

Attend events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We encourage every SIG to participate to the Summit and PTG events if possible.
SIGs can have:

* PTG rooms for SIG in-person group discussions

* Forum sessions to get wider community feedback on issues within the SIG
  scope.

* Speaking slots are reserved for SIG update presentations at Summits. This
  is a great way to spread the word about a SIG and recruit new members.


SIG resources
-------------

Git repositories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While SIGs do not produce software that is included in the regular OpenStack
release, SIGs can own git repositories, for example for documentation or add-on
software.

You can read more about `how to create a new git repository`_. In particular,
you will need to register this new repository in the `sigs-repos.yaml`_ file
(like in this `example for register a repository under SIG`_),
`add Gerrit permission`_ and `ask Infra team to create core team`_ for
Gerrit.

Doc repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A classic use case for a git repository in a SIG is to publish peer-reviewed
documentation. Using `Sphinx`_ and `Zuul jobs`_ it is easy to publish
documentation under `docs.openstack.org`_.

A good example of such a repository is `openstack/auto-scaling-sig`, which
includes `Sphinx`_ configuration and `Zuul jobs`_ to publish the
`Auto-scaling SIG docs`_.

StoryBoard task tracker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use a git repository, you can use `StoryBoard`_ to track tasks in the
SIG. Adding `use_storyboard: true` to the repository definition in
`gerrit/projects.yaml`_ will automatically generate a corresponding project
in StoryBoard. Here is an `example for add config in gerrit/projects`_.
