    A SIG for SIGs so to speak. A SIG to discuss OpenStack SIGs themselves,
    to encourage workgroups to become SIGs, accompany them along the way,
    give them tools and processes to be efficient. More generally, this SIG
    will discuss how to best close the loop between users and developers of
    OpenStack.
