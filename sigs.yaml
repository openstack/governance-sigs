    Ansible is an orchestration tool that is becoming increasingly common
    in usage across many parts of OpenStack.  There are a few deployment
    projects that are using it, alongside many of our CI systems.  This
    SIG exists to help create a colloborative space between different
    interested parties to share Ansible code under one group.
    It is also responsible of the OpenStack namespace on Ansible's galaxy.

    Formerly known as the API-WG, the API SIG scope is to improve the developer
    experience of API users by converging the OpenStack API to a consistent and
    pragmatic RESTful design. The working group creates guidelines that all
    OpenStack projects should follow for new development, and promotes
    convergence of new APIs and future versions of existing APIs.

    The scope of the Bare Metal Sig is to promote the development and use
    of Ironic and other OpenStack bare metal software. This will include
    marketing efforts like case studies of Ironic clusters in industry
    and academia, supporting integration of Ironic with projects like
    Airship and the Kubernetes Cluster API, coordinating presentations
    for industry events, developing documentation and tutorials,
    gathering feedback from the community on usage and feature gaps, and
    other broader community-facing efforts to encourage the adoption of
    Ironic as a bare-metal management tool.

    The Cloud Research SIG aims to bridge the gap between Academic
    Research in Cloud Computing and Technology projects within OpenStack.
    The group's purpose is to establish a collaboration space for Cloud
    researchers to discuss advancements in Cloud research and methodologies
    and to implement them in OpenStack. The group is also a communication
    space for researchers looking for guidance on how to evaluate their
    research work ( e.g., placement algorithms, model-free frameworks...etc.)
    in Openstack.

  scope: >
    The scope of the Containers SIG is to share practices for the
    build, deploy, and operate of OpenStack using application
    containers. This is not another deployment tool of containers.
    Instead, this SIG should have as members people from the
    different projects in the business of dealing with OpenStack
    in application containers. The participants should be
    interested in container building, willing to share their
    practices, and/or define common practices for use within
    all OpenStack projects. One example of the deliverables of
    the SIG would be a common series of "rules" for the bindep
    files relevant for container image building. These rules
    would then be applied consistenty across all the OpenStack
    projects, but also maintained over time by this group.
    Another example of common ground would be sharing how
    deployment projects are writing their container "check
    probes", and figure out what can be re-used. In other words,
    defining together what are application containers "readiness"
    and "aliveness" for each service project.

    The scope of the PowerVMStacker is to provide OpenStack support for the
    POWER CPU architecture on the PowerVM hypervisor.
    This enables support of Linux, AIX and IBM i for PowerVM systems.
    There are currently three supported components of the PowerVM driver -
    nova-powervm – Support for Nova use cases.
    ceilometer-powervm – Gathers instance/VM statistics.
    networking-powervm – An optional Neutron ML2 agent that supports PowerVM
    Shared Ethernet Adapters (SEAs). Users should utilize this if their environment
    requires Shared Ethernet. However, they may also use the standard Open vSwitch
    agent from the Neutron project to support advanced functions such as Security Groups,
    Quality of Service (QoS), overlay networks (VXLANs) and more.
