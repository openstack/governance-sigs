    Formerly known as the API-WG, the API SIG scope is to improve the developer
    experience of API users by converging the OpenStack API to a consistent and
    pragmatic RESTful design. The working group creates guidelines that all
    OpenStack projects should follow for new development, and promotes
    convergence of new APIs and future versions of existing APIs.

    The goal of the FEMDC SIG (formerly Fog/Edge/Massively Distributed Clouds
    Working Group) is to debate and investigate how OpenStack can address
    Fog/Edge Computing use-cases (i.e. the supervision and use of a large
    number of remote data centers through a collaborative distributed
    OpenStack system).

    The Scientific SIG (formerly Scientific Working Group) is dedicated to
    representing and advancing the use-cases and needs of research and
    high-performance computing atop OpenStack. It's also a great forum for
    cross-institutional collaboration. If you are (or would like to) run
    OpenStack to support researchers/scientists/academics and/or HPC/HTC,
    then please join!

    Coordinate the use and development of several OpenStack projects which
    can be combined in various ways to manage OpenStack infrastructure in a
    policy-driven fashion, reacting to failures and other events by
    automatically healing and optimising services.

    A SIG for SIGs so to speak. A SIG to discuss OpenStack SIGs themselves,
    to encourage workgroups to become SIGs, accompany them along the way,
    give them tools and processes to be efficient. More generally, this SIG
    will discuss how to best close the loop between users and developers of
    OpenStack.
