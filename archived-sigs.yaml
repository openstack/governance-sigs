    The scope of the Containers SIG is to share practices for the
    build, deploy, and operate of OpenStack using application
    containers. This is not another deployment tool of containers.
    Instead, this SIG should have as members people from the
    different projects in the business of dealing with OpenStack
    in application containers. The participants should be
    interested in container building, willing to share their
    practices, and/or define common practices for use within
    all OpenStack projects. One example of the deliverables of
    the SIG would be a common series of "rules" for the bindep
    files relevant for container image building. These rules
    would then be applied consistenty across all the OpenStack
    projects, but also maintained over time by this group.
    Another example of common ground would be sharing how
    deployment projects are writing their container "check
    probes", and figure out what can be re-used. In other words,
    defining together what are application containers "readiness"
    and "aliveness" for each service project.
